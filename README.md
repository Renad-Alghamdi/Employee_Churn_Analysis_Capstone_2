# Employee_Churn_Analysis_Capstone_2
Welcome to the Employee Churn Analysis Capstone 2 project! In this project, we explore a comprehensive HR dataset containing 14,999 samples, each representing an employee in the company. The primary goal is to predict whether an employee will stay or leave. We delve into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics, preprocess the data, and select the Random Forest algorithm for modeling. The model is trained, evaluated, and the findings are summarized. Additionally, a Streamlit app is developed for easy interaction with the predictive model.The app, predicting employee retention or departure, is deployed on AWS for scalability and reliability.
